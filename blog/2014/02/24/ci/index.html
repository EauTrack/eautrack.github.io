                <p>Parallelization, Selenium, AWS, and a CI server are common implementations for agile<br>shops, and we are no exception. Since I’ve been here, maintenance hasn’t<br>been a nightmare, nor has it been a dream. We’ve learned a few things<br>to streamline our maintenance process and would love to share the things<br>that made our lives easier.</p>
<p>When looking at what was eating up our time, we found the differences<br>between our CI environment and average developer’s environment was at<br>the forefront. Most of us at Instructure use Macs, a few of us Windows,<br>and there are a handful Linux users. Among us, browser choice varies,<br>but the most popular is Chrome. Engineers develop locally using their<br>own OS, browser type/version and the Ruby Selenium driver to power<br>tests. Listed below are a few of the differences we found:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS images were Ubuntu</li>
<li>Variance in browser versions</li>
<li>Selenium grid uses Java stand alone server VS local specs running using native Ruby driver</li>
<li>Variance in native event capabilities VS Jenkins running exclusively using native events</li>
<li>Parallelization in CI vs single threaded specs in developer’s environment</li>
</ol>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>We began to strive for consistency between the average dev environment and<br>the CI environments, where we could, without sacraficing production like implementation.<br>This helped with mitigating many intermittency issues. During this<br>process, it simplified the CI upgrade process while edging maintenance<br>towards dreamland and further from Elm St.</p>
<p>So, what did we do to make this happen? First, all logic for Selenium<br>driver code was changed from Selenium grid\Java stand-alone server to<br>the native Ruby Selenium driver. This change immediately resulted in<br>noticeable stability improvements, and easier resolution for<br>intermittency creep from tests.</p>
<p>In the past, we had challenges reproducing errors, locally, that our CI<br>server would throw because of the variance in environments. We spent a<br>lot of time debugging these errors, and had to create CI environments<br>that devs could SSH into, to debug the spec failures. This was highly<br>inefficient, and not consistent with the nature or true purpose of CI.<br>Making the two environments consistent gave us more time to work on<br>other things, instead of time-consuming and meaningless failures that were challenging and<br>intensive to debug. Now we are easily able to (for the most part)<br>reproduce all errors produced by our CI server.</p>
<p>Along the way, we also found Selenium grid was not the ideal solution for us.<br>The main reason being the variance in spec outcomes<br>between dev environments and CI, resulting in too much overhead for<br>maintenance and upgrades, while also sapping dev time on CI spec<br>debugging. Many shops use a hardware infrastructure that is distributed<br>across multiple boxes and the tests are farmed out to them; this is<br>ideal for Selenium grid. We, however, prefer one big box with<br>parallelization done internally, reducing the need for a Java stand-alone<br>server and Selenium grid. Capabilities for the drivers are consumed from<br>config files written at runtime for different browsers and we have no<br>need to push each test to a Selenium hub to be farmed out to a worker.<br>We found this complicated setup offered little reward and brought on<br>noticeable burden in maintenance and stability while introducing a<br>variance in spec outcomes.</p>
<p>Making these changes made our lives noticeably easier. When managing<br>or implementing a CI environment, we believe it’s prudent to not only consider your core<br>tech architecture, but the relationship with your developer’s workflow.<br>Although complex implementations of Selenium grid and multiple browsers can be beneficial,<br>it may add more complications than are worth it.<br>We recommend a lean implementation of Selenium, using the driver of the native application<br>language for tighter integration and better maintenance with more consistency between test runs. </p>
